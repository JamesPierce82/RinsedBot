# RinsedBot
A bot for the MAD Club Discord.

Download or Clone the repo to your local computer. You will need to have node installed, as well as NPM.

Once you have NPM, Node, and the repo downloaded, you will need to run the following command in node:
'''npm install discord.js node-opus --save'''
This will install the proper modules.

The conf.js file is where you will store your token. In the case of the MAD Club token, the bots token will be stored on the server that is hosting it.
